This is [the 2nd (2008) edition](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp.html) of Jurafsky and Martin's SLP textbook.

In this repo, we focus on the sequence and material from **the 2nd edition**.

   > This is an excellent introduction of NLP. The history and the structure of key issues in NLP really help me comb the understanding of NLP. Good job, Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.
