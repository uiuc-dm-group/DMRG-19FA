# DMRG-19FA

This repo covers the paper discussed by our DMRG in 2019 Fall. It covers mainly classic NLP papers and books.

## Speech and Language Processing (SLP)
This is [the 2nd (2008) edition](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp.html) of Jurafsky and Martin's SLP textbook. Noticing that the third version is also ready [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), and there being some difference in the material organization. In this repo, we focus on the sequence and material from the 2nd edition.
