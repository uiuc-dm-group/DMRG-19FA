## Speech and Language Processing (SLP)
This is [the 2nd (2008) edition](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp.html) of Jurafsky and Martin's SLP textbook. Noticing that [the third version](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) is also ready, and there being some difference in the material organization. In this repo, we focus on the sequence and material from **the 3rd edition**.

   > This is an excellent introduction of NLP. The history and the structure of key issues in NLP really help me comb the understanding of NLP. Good job, Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.

   > My favourite quote: "_We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done._", by the great Alan Turing

2. **Chapter 2: Regular Expressions, Text Normalization, Edit Distance**
    _Jurafsky and Martin_

    > This chapter is very important and helpful with MP1. (and much more detailed and consolidated.)
    > Furthermore, the idea is more related to Han's information cluster idea; looking forward to Chap 9, another LM, RNN.
