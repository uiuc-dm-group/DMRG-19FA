# SLP notes.

## Chap1
1. the names following are exchangable: speech and language processing, human language technology, natural language processing, computational linguistics.
2. The popular tasks of the NLP include conversational agent, dialogue system, machine translation, and Question answering, etc.; and .. information extraction, word sense disambiguation, spelling correction, grammar checking, etc.

3. useful NLP point of views.

  • Phonetics and Phonology — knowledge about linguistic sounds

  • Morphology — knowledge of the meaningful components of words

  • Syntax — knowledge of the structural relationships between words

  • Semantics — knowledge of meaning

  • Pragmatics — knowledge of the relationship of meaning to the goals and intentions of the speaker

  • Discourse — knowledge about linguistic units larger than a single utterance

4. motivation behind NLP:
- Rules behind language but representing all language.
- logic presentation <predicate expressions>
- statistical point
- ML/EM/sequence analysis

5. _We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done._ -- Alan Turing

6. History of NLP
- 1940s to 1950s: Foundational Insights
- 1957 to 1970: the two camps: sybolic paradigm and the stochastic paradigm.
- 1970 to 1983: the four paradigms: stochastic; logic-based; natural language understanding; disclosure modeling
- 1983 to 1993: empiricism and finite-state-models redux. <natural language generation>
- 1994 to 1999: the field comes together <probailistic models; data-driven models; pos tagging; reference resolution; parsing; discourse processing> + machine hardware improving.
- 2000 to 2008: the rise of machien learning <large amount open data; statistical machine learning; high-performance machine; ML unsupervised learning apporaches.>
